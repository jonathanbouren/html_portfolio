<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm glad you found this site, and I hope there
  is something about it that catches your eye.<br>
  I have been working as a paramedic for 15 years. I <br>
  intend on using the experience I have with EMR systems <br>
  and patient care reports to create user-friendly and accessible <br>
  platforms that allow for the seamless and safe transition of <br>
  user data through all necessary elements of the healthcare system.
